# Timing of Early Life Exposures is Important

## Psychiatric disorders in children and adolescents...

- NSCH estimates 1 in 6 youth aged 6-17 have a 'treatable mental health condition'
- Meta-analytic estimates: 50% of all lifetime mental illnesses begin by age 14; 75% by age 25

- Causes difficulties later in life, including poor educational achievement, recurrent unemployment, substance abuse, relationship difficulties, and further psychopathology, including psychiatric crises

- Monthly ambient lead associated with behavioral problems independently of maternal education, community material deprivation, blood lead concentrations, nearby greenness, and traffic

- cg18705808 associated with the average PM2.5
- pathway & network analysis = little similarity between first two trimesters
- *TMEM184A*, the gene regulated by cg18705808, involved in inflammatory pathways

- New method for screening timing-specific effects in high dimensional settings: traditional false discovery rate methods + distributed lag model (DLM)
- Achieved increased sensitivity for associations limited to specific periods of time compared to traditional two-stage approaches
- Real-world analysis: DNAm at 353 CpG sites measured at age 12 were significantly associated with PM2.5 exposure during distinct weeks of pregnancy

High-resolution and spatiotemporal exposure assessment models for:

- Ambient air pollution: PM2.5, Ozone, NO2 (wildfire smoke plumes)
- Heat: heat waves, extreme temperature, humidity, precipitation

- Estimate causal effects of transient treatments on acute outcomes
- EHR-based cohort + place-based exposures advantages
- Within-individual design prevents confounding by 'time-invariant' (e.g. within a month) characteristics
- Stratification on year, month, day of week prevents confounding by temporal trends
- Conditional logistic regression; person-time unit of observation
- Statistical adjustment for common confounders (temperature, humidity, holidays, secular or periodic trends)

## Daily PM2.5 and 13,176 CCHMC Psychiatric Encounters Between 2011 and 2015

- Increased PM2.5 associated with increased risk one (7% [2, 12]) and two (5% [0, 10]) days later
  - Adjustment disorder and suicidality increased risk one day later
  - Stronger associations in highly deprived communities for anxiety and suicidality
  - Weaker associations in highly deprived communities for adjustment disorder

- Driven by associations with *anxiety* disorders (OR 1.68, [1.06, 2.67]) and *depression* disorders (OR 1.20, [0.99, 1.46])

## Population's Unified Life Stress Evaluation

Temporal measures of collective mental health and well-being among the population served by CCHMC:

- Number of mass shooting (National Gun Violence Archive)
- Suicide, suicidality, non-suicidal self-injury rates
- Neighborhood-level rates of acute mental health crises reported in healthcare settings
- Trends in anxiety and depression keywords from social media and search engines
- Pulse surveys and public sentiments
- AQI, heat waves, pollen, mold
- Cincy Air Watch
- Gun violence, violent crime, gunshots
- Housing infractions, eviction filings
- Alleged child abuse and neglect rates
- Food insecurity
- Civic engagement
